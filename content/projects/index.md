Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### 1. Insura-tune Anything ( private project for CCC is)
**Description**: An internal enterprise application designed for loading insurance documentation and images from structured and unstructured databases (SQL, MongoDB, sqlite) for fine-tuning using LORA and RLHF. 

### 2. Fine-tune Anything
**Description**: Developed a quantization and fine-tuning library with auto-loading, quantize model, and fine-tuning for personal data and RLHF.

### 4. Language Robot
**Description**: Developed real-time control of drones and robots using multimodal-based models such as CLIP and GPT. [**Try it here**](https://github.com/prakyathkantharaju/learn-to-move)

### 5. Resume Assistant
**Description**: A multi-functional LLM agent to evaluate, edit, and write resumes and cover letters for job applications using langchain RAG and Gradio.

### 6. Meta-learning Personalization
**Description**: Implemented a meta-learning algorithm for adaptable and personalized wearable device settings based on user perception and comfort.

### 7. Time-series Estimation
**Description**: Created a state-of-the-art time series algorithm using machine learning to estimate metabolic energy in real-time using Gaussian mixture models.

### 8. Real-time Activity Control
**Description**: Devised a deep learning model to recognize human activities, improving user interaction with wearable devices.

### 9. HIL Toolkit
**Description**: Devised a real-time data acquisition and control framework for collecting physiological signals to optimize exoskeleton assistance by 20%, emphasizing human multi-sensory feedback. [**Try it here**](https://github.com/Prakyathkantharaju/HIL_toolkit)

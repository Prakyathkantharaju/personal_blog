Hello World! I'm Prakyath Kantharaju, a tech-savvy, robot-loving, code-crunching Ph.D. holder who's all about making machines smarter and life easier. When I'm not busy fine-tuning large-scale ML systems or playing with advanced robotics, you can find me diving deep into the realms of machine learning libraries, cloud technologies, and databases.

My journey in the tech universe started at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I powered through to a Ph.D. in Robotics. I specialize in making wearable robots more personal - because who says robots can't have a personal touch?

In my professional escapades, I've interned at CCC Intelligent Solutions, juggling between natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal LLMs. Currently, I'm the R&D Intern extraordinaire, creating tools that understand and process human language â€“ pretty cool, right?

When I'm not immersed in the world of robotics and machine learning, I'm probably out there exploring Chicago's Coffee shops or brewing my own coffee. I believe in a future where technology and humans coexist in perfect harmony, and I'm doing my bit to make that happen!

Want to know more about my adventures in tech and robotics? Drop by my website or connect with me on LinkedIn or twitter/X. Let's make the future awesome together!
